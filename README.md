This repository contains a mock registration form created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The form uses custom error messages to indicate invalid or incomplete input, instead of relying on the browser defaults. The form does not currently collect any data, as there is no database.

## Key features:

- **Custom error messages:** The form displays custom error messages to users when their input is invalid or incomplete.
- **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:** The form is created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which makes it easy to modify and customize.
- **Single page:** The form is a single page registration form, which makes it easy to use and navigate.


This activity is a good starting point for students who want to learn more about form validation and how to create their own registration forms using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
